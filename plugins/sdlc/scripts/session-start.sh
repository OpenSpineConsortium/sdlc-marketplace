# hooks/hooks.json; it is the template's .claude/hooks/session-start.sh.
# What it prints becomes part of the session's context: how far this checkout
# is ahead of and behind the default branch, and the top of the board. The
# board is the file STATE.md on the branch "board", rewritten by
# .github/workflows/board.yml, so it is read from origin/board and never from
# the checkout (docs/agents/STATE.md here only describes it). The hook never
# fails the session: every path ends in exit 0, each fetch is cut off after
# ten seconds, and the output stays under about 130 lines.
